# APCS-projectCode
Here are all the projects from APCS that I created in Java

1.**Tic Tac Toe**

   This is a classis Tic Tac Toe game. The user is able to play Tic Tac Toe with another player. 
   
2.**Rock Paper Sissors Spock Lizard**

   From the TV show Big Bang Theory, Rock Paper Sissors Spock Lizard is a twist off the original rock paper sissors game. With 5 options in this game, it is more complex than the simple game of Rock Paper Sissors. 

3.**Black Jack**
   
   This black jack program was my first experience with GUI. The user is able to play blackjack against a computer.
   
4.**Hangman**

   The hangman program used arrays and user inputs to allow the user to play hangman with the computer. The computer would pikc a random work from a word bank. The user would keep guessing letters once at a time until the player either guesses the word or loses the game.
  
5.**Change Counter** 

   This program calculates the most efficient combination of change to return to a customer.
